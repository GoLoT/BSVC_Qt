Mailing List (Google Groups)
----------------------------
There are two mailing lists for BSVC: a 'users' list for general discussions
concerning BSVC including bug reports, enhancements requests, and general usage
tips.  Anyone who uses BSVC regularly should probably subscribe to this list:

* bsvc-users@googlegroups.com
  (https://https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bsvc-users)

Additionally, a low-traffic 'announcements' list has been created for announcing
new releases and major bugs:

* bsvc-announce@googlegroups.com:
  (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bsvc-announce)

If you are planning on using BSVC in a course or for non-trivial use, you should
probably subscribe to this list.
